# Digital-Card

**How It's Made:**
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

A digital bio card project using React. This was one of my first times using React (it was fun. more to follow). Each different element on the page was broken down into a React componenet and then combined together and rendered with ReactDOM.


Lessons Learned:
It's been too long since I used CSS. It was initially a struggle bus to remember all the stylings I need.
