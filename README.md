# Digital-Card

**How It's Made:**
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

A digital bio card project using React. This was one of my first times using React (it was fun. more to follow). Each different element on the page was broken down into a React componenet and then combined together and rendered with ReactDOM. Note this was made on Scrimba.


Lessons Learned:
It's been too long since I used CSS. It was initially a struggle bus to remember all the stylings I need. 

**=======

Quick start:

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
````

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
```
